What is the pipeline used for?,"The pipeline is used for natural language processing, specifically for generating answers to student questions in an educational context."
Which step is used for helping students distinguish between AI and rule-based algorithms?,"The first step of the pipeline is data collection and preprocessing, which includes text augmentation, policy filtering, and intent recognition. It helps students understand the importance of raw data, as well as the need for data cleaning and transformation."
How is intent recognition used in the pipeline?,Intent recognition is used to classify which context should be used to answer a question; this helps the model give more relevant answers by using more relevant contexts.
Which transformer models were tested for question answering?,"Two transformer models were tested for question answering: DistilBERT and T5. These models are extractive and generative, respectively."
Why is DistilBERT ideal for practical application in the classroom context?,DistilBERT is ideal for practical application in the classroom context because it is a distilled version of BERT which has smaller model size and faster inference speed.
What are the two main tasks for students in Build-a-Bot?,The two main tasks for students in Build-a-Bot are designing their bot's architecture and training their bot using labeled data.
"Which tool interface is used to present Python code from Jupyter notebooks alongside visuals, explanations, and interaction opportunities?","PySimpleGUI is used to make all of the notebooks accessible through a PySimpleGUI interface, which is downloaded by instructors as an executable file."
What does each step of the pipeline have its own devoted notebook for students to input data before moving onto the next step?,Each step of the pipeline has its own devoted notebook for students to input data before moving onto the next step. This helps students understand each part of the process individually and build their understanding progressively.
What are the intents and contexts defined by the instructor at the beginning of a session in the contextualized BERT-based architecture?,"Intents and contexts are defined by the instructor at the beginning of a session in the contextualized BERT-based architecture. They serve as labels for training the model, as well as providing the necessary information for generating answers to student questions."
How does DistilBERT answer student questions?,DistilBERT answers student questions by using pretrained transformer models and fine-tuning them on labeled data.
What is the difference between extractive and generative models for question answering?,"Extractive models extract answers from given contexts, while generative models generate new answers based on input prompts. Both approaches have their advantages and limitations."
Why are students encouraged to try training with both transformers?,Students are encouraged to try training with both transformers to gain a better understanding of each approach and their use cases in different scenarios.
What documentation is downloaded alongside the executable file to provide information about Build-a-Bot and how to use it?,"The documentation downloaded alongside the executable file provides information about Build-a-Bot and how to use it, including installation instructions, user guides, and troubleshooting tips."
Which testing suite contains contexts about each step of the machine learning process?,"The machine learning suite contains contexts about each step of the machine learning process (e.g., data labeling, training)."
What is provided as a sample for students and teachers to see what a good dataset for the tool looks like?,"The second testing suite is based off of the Utah State Board of Education's open-source fifth grade science textbook, with seventy-five questions labeled with one of five intents – Patterns in Earth’s Features, Earth’s Water, Weathering and Erosion, Interactions between Systems, and Impact on Humans – which are based on earth science chapters on the textbooks."
Where is the model deployed in a new window using the chatbotAI library?,The model is deployed in a new window using the chatbotAI library to provide students with a user-friendly interface for interacting with their bot.
Which intent recognition model is used with the student's final chatbots?,The contextualized BERT-based architecture is used with the student's final chatbots for generating answers based on the given intents and contexts.
What are the topics of the recognized intents when using the T5 question answering model?,"The topics of the recognized intents when using the T5 question answering model include Patterns in Earth’s Features, Earth’s Water, Weathering and Erosion, Interactions between Systems, and Impact on Humans."
What can students learn from building their own bot with Build-a-Bot?,"Students can learn various skills from building their own bot with Build-a-Bot, including data preprocessing, machine learning concepts, and natural language processing techniques."
